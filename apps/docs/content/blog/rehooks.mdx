# Introduction

Welcome to the very first post of Rehooks blog. This is a post to introduce and demonstrate the decisions made in the creation of Rehooks. So let's get started!

## What is Rehooks?

Rehooks is CLI tool that helps you to insert custom production-ready hooks into your project. So basically, Rehooks is a reference that allows you to build your own custom hooks with ease!

## Why did I build Rehooks?

I was looking for a way to streamline the process of creating custom hooks, and unfortunately, the dependecy wasn't the correct way, because I had to deal with the `limitation`, `bundle size`, `performance`, and `maintenance` issues. So I decided to create Rehooks to solve these problems.

## How does Rehooks work?

Initially, we maintain a separate TypeScript library called `rehooks-ts`, which houses all our custom hooks. These hooks are then converted into a JSON file, effectively serving as an [API](/docs/api) for the `rehooks-cli`. In essence, when you need a hook, you simply choose from the curated list available through the [API](/docs/api), and the CLI handles the import directly into your project with ease. This streamlined process ensures seamless integration and rapid development.

## Why use Rehooks?

You still want to deal with the `limitation`, `bundle size`, `performance`, and `maintenance` issues, but you don't want to deal with the `complexity` and `code duplication` issues. Rehooks is here to help you with all these issues.

By leveraging the Rehooks CLI, you can significantly streamline your codebase by eliminating unused and duplicated code. This powerful tool empowers you to enhance the reusability and maintainability of your custom hooks, allowing you to focus on building efficient and scalable applications. With Rehooks, you'll not only optimize your development workflow but also ensure a cleaner, more organized code structure for long-term success.
