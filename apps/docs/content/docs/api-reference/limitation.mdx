# Rate Limit

To ensure fair usage and maintain optimal performance for all users, our API enforces a rate limit of **10 requests per 5 seconds**. This limitation is in place to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of the service.

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting is a mechanism that restricts the number of API requests a user can make within a specific time frame. Once the limit is reached, further requests will be blocked until the time window resets.

## Rate Limit Details

- **Limit:** 10 requests per 5 seconds.
- **Scope:** The limit is applied per IP address.
- **Response Headers:** Each API response includes headers that provide information about your current rate limit status:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in the time window.
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current window.

## Example Response Headers

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 7
```
