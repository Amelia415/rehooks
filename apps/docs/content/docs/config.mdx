# Configuration

By using `init` command, which initializes the configuration file and generates the `rehooks.json` file, you can customize the configuration of Rehooks.

## Usage

```bash
npx rehooks-cli@latest init
```

## Configuration

The `rehooks.json` file, includes a `directory` property, which specifies the directory where the hooks will be inserted.

```json title="rehooks.json"
{
  "directory": "src/hooks"
}
```
