# Installation

To get started with Rehooks, you need to install the package using your preferred package manager. Here are the steps to install Rehooks:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @febelen/rehooks-ts
```

You successfully installed Rehooks! Now you can start using the hooks in your project.

## Usage

Once you have installed Rehooks, you can start using the hooks in your project. Here's an example of how to use the `useCounter` hook:

```jsx title="Component.tsx"
import { useCounter } from "@febelen/rehooks-ts";

function Component() {
  const [count, increment, decrement, reset, setCount] = useCounter(0);

  function multiply(value) {
    setCount((prev) => prev * value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => multiply(2)}>Multiply by 2</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </>
  );
}
```
