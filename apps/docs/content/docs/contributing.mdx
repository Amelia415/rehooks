# Contributing

## Getting Started

To get started you must clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyr33x/rehooks-ts.git
cd rehooks-ts
npm install
```

## Hooks

Want to add a new hook? Follow these steps:

```bash
npm run generate:hook
```

This will generate a new hook in the `packages/core/src/hooks` directory.
